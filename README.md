# Ascaris_Microbiome
Analysis of microbiome data from Ascaris infections in pigs


## Goal 1: Figure out whether (even how) cross-contamination between PCR wells is present 

### Do negative samples with reads/ASVs reported taxonomically diverse composition?

### Does proximity of samples on PCR plates predict higher compositonal similarity


## Goal 2: How much "eukaryote conamination" is present in the sequencing 

### How many ASVs and which taxa

### What proporion of reads

### For all/most/which samples?
